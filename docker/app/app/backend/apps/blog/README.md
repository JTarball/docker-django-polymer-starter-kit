## 'blog' App

A basic 'blog' app perfect for website announcements / basic blog page

- simple & basic

- superadmin will see all posts
- normal users/anonymous users will only see publish posts

- static page with a list of blog posts which can be filtered by user, year, published
- detail page for each post

- use django admin interface (superadmin only) to add/edit posts 
- code highlighting via <code></code> blocks powered by pygments
- can tag posts using Taggit django app
- add super fast search via 'search app' (see models.py for example how to (very simple add three members to model and post save signal))
