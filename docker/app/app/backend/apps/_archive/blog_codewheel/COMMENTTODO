- need to fix related_save on admin.py


find highest match - has to be at least percent 
- cant find then alert user
- remove? 




assume likelihood of a match within post -- unlikely




- only display published posts 

- search capability
- include + excluding tag capability 
- comments how to link to paragraphs
- search show autocomplete then results with x to close
- table of contents (on save - calculation - like polymer)
- add table of updates like table of contents
- write tests for utils.py

secondary
- personal page  (active coding)
   - add card (code / link / words(cool font))
- admin email
- login for guests



- Note
- Note needs field synced to Post Content

- how to save / merge
- PostRevision very important




------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- breadcrumbs - Basically Done  (NEEDS TEMPLATE / TIDYING CODE)
- auto tagging done (BASIC BUT WORKS)
- search - need to explain how redis works sorted set
	need to double check with multiple model Posts that are stored in set (ids are different so should work)
