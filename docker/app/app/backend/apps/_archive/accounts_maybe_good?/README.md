This is the accounts apps:
 The accounts deals with everything to do with front-end users include registration / activation / admin / user preferences.

The 'accounts' app is actually divided into two apps:
	registration --- deals with user registration & activation
	backend  --- user preferences / account profiles / definition of accounts Model (User -- settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL) / front-end backend (admin page)



the NORMAL django admin is for maintanence (super admin) and shouldnt be visible to users.
