## 'project' Directory 

This is your main project folder

### Introduction
This folder contains project specific files (as oppose to django apps)

### Directories / Files

* README.md            - this file
* bin/                 - all executable / run scripts
* settings/            - settings folder
* __static/__          - static folder - place for all css/html/images/custom polymer elements
* __templates/__       - should be self-explanatory 
* test_factories/      - factories fo
* utils/               - useful scripts / utilty functions
* views/               - reusable mixin views
* urls.py              - should be self-explanatory 

*( Given the advent of more reliance on front-end development, better user experience and mobile devices you should probably spend most of your time in the __bold__ folders. )*
